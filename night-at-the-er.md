I spent most of last night in the ER and we didn’t get home until 2 AM.

Yesterday I was working on our tractor attaching the backhoe when the 
implement shifted and caught the end of my glove and pulled the middle 
finger of my right hand into the hole for the attachment pin and sheared 
my finger off at the first knuckle.

Julie called 911 and an ambulance got here quickly and hauled me to a 
trauma center in Independence. Shock and adrenaline are amazing things 
and there was very little pain the whole time. The IV in my wrist was 
actually more painful than the finger injury.

The “leftovers” were too smushed to be reattached so they cleaned up the 
wound best they could and sutured it down. We had some issues with bleeding 
but the ER doc eventually got it stopped.

I’m now home with some heavy-duty pain meds and anti-biotics. Monday morning 
I need to see an orthopedic surgeon for next steps.

Everyone from the EMTs to the nurses and Doctors at the trauma center were 
amazing even in the midst of COVID-19.

This is the most serious injury I’ve ever had. Last night I got my first IV 
and first stitches. As you can imagine typing is going to be an issue, 
especially since I’m a touch typist and I essentially type for a living. 
Oh, and I need to program a new fingerprint into Touch ID on my Mac; the 
one I used to use is gone.
